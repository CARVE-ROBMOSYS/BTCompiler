# GRoot experiments for CARVE

This folder includes some BT specifications developed with the [GRoot](https://github.com/Eurecat/Groot)
Behavior-Tree editor created by the Mood2Be ITP.

The files `carve_use_case_3_*.xml` do all encode the CARVE [use-case #3](https://github.com/CARVE-ROBMOSYS/Coordination/wiki/D2.1-Use-Cases-Description).
They represent different trade-offs w.r.t. the parameterization of sub-trees.
